<p id="speech">My Hobby is reading interesting and knowledgable books in my free time. Whenever I go home from my school I like to read such books after completing my homework. I am 10 years old and read in 4th grade. Now I know very well that reading is a very good habit which can make me complete. This hobby can be developed by anyone. However, I got this naturally. Reading books keep one always happy and busy. It is a good source of enjoyment, knowledge, inspiration, and instruction. It makes us disciplined, loyal, punctual, and most importantly, a successful person in life.</p>
